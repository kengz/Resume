Hello,

I am Keng, an undergraduate who loves theories $-$ Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics. What I love more is to put the knowledge to good use $-$ please hear my confession:

Being a theorist, I feel the need for redemption, to contribute back by solving real world problems. I spent the last three summers thinking and writing theories, mainly on computational geometry and foundations of quantum mechanics. Don't get me wrong, I loved my work; at Perimeter Institute, they gave me an office, fed me cookies, and even let me scribble all over their wall to discuss really crazy ideas - we were rewriting the foundations of quantum mechanics using quantum computation and paradoxes.

When I stepped back to see the Great Wall of Sribbles with my fellow theorists, I realized some of these ideas would grow into new theories that reshape the world. It was a moment of clarity $-$ I knew my purpose, what got me excited $-$ I wanted to contribute.

$``$If we theorists could too tackle problems that are more relevant and urgent, imagine the implications,$"$ I asked myself. This is why I turn to Computer Science; abstract math is cool, but it'd be even cooler if I can build something that impacts the world - I want to build things using my knowledge.

Currently I still wish to go into graduate school for machine learning and AI, because the ultimate thing I wish to build is an intelligent machine. Meanwhile, I'd like an adventure in the industry, and I love to code and build - I love to see my thoughts come true.

If you have a position for someone who loves to tinker and build thing, I'm up for it. Be it algorithms, statistics, vector spaces, machine learning, or rapid deployment of an app on a server, I'll think, theorize, design and build from start to end.

Lastly, I appreciate your attention.\\


Regards,\\
{\em Keng}
