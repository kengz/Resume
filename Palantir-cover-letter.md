Hello,

I am Keng, an undergraduate who loves theories – Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics. What I love more is to put the knowledge to good use – please hear my confession:

Being a theorist, I feel the need for redemption, to contribute back by solving real world problems. I spent the last two summers thinking and writing theories, mainly on computational geometry and foundations of quantum mechanics. Don't get me wrong, I loved it; at Perimeter Institute, they gave me an office, fed me cookies, and even let me scribble on the wall to discuss ideas – really radical ideas.

When I stepped back to see the Great Wall of Sribbles by my fellow theorists, I realized some of these ideas would grow into new theories that reshape the world. It was a moment of clarity – I knew my purpose, what got me excited – I wanted to contribute.

"If we theorists could too tackle problems that are more relevant and urgent, imagine the impact," I asked myself. This is why I turn to Computer Science; abstract math is cool, but it'd be even cooler if I can actually make something out of it!

As of now I am still set for getting a PhD, which means I'll stay in the academia for years. While I can, I want go on an intellectual adventure in the industry, and this honestly is why I'm applying for an internship. 

If you have a position for a theorist who gets a kick by writing math theories to solve problems, then get all excited over it like a kid, you may have found that person.

Lastly, I appreciate your attention.


Regards,
Keng
