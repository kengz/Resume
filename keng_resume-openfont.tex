% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\descript{| EXCEL Undergraduate Researcher}
\location{Summer 2015 | Easton, PA}
Worked with \textbf{\href{http://www.cs.lafayette.edu/~gexia/}{Prof Ge Xia}} on Vertex Cover - a signature NP-hard problem. Studied its complexity using Measure and Conquer to probe the NP-hard class.\\
\sectionsep
\location{Summer 2013 | Easton, PA}
Worked with \textbf{\href{http://www.cs.lafayette.edu/~gexia/}{Prof Ge Xia}} on Yao Graphs - useful in wireless networks. Proved that the shortest paths always exist for Y-5, and not for YY-5. Published in SOCG'14.
